ESTIMATE : 1 day(or 3 hours)
AS A     : user
I WANT   : As a user is specifying a Circle, during the drag, a 'current'
           circle should be on display. As the user drags, the 'current'
           circle changes in real time so that a circle is drawn with
           centre at users initial circle click, with radius out to
           the current dragged mouse position.
SO THAT  : I can see the circle I am about to build on release of the mouse
           button.

ESTIMATE : 1 day (or 3-4 hours)
AS A     : user
I WANT   : To be able to select the current drawing color, to be applied

PRIORITY : 3
ESTIMATE : 1 hour
ISSUE    : Currently ,you can't tell which mode "Circle", "Rectangle", ...
           is currently selected. Is JButton correct, is there a way
           to highlight the currently selected mode?

TYPE     : BUG 3
NAME     : Architecture behind choosing selection mode is poor
OWNER    : Alexander Yeara
PRIORITY : N/A (not for part 1)
ESTIMATE : N/A
ISSUE    : Code is not modular and is difficult to expand. Need a better
           architecture behind selecting a drawing mode, and handling
           the drawing events. Consider some design patterns here.
           Refactor ShapeChooserPanel and PaintPanel to get rid of the
           'if' blocks in the PaintPanel mouse event code.

TYPE     : BUG 4
NAME     : Architecture behind Model is poor
OWNER    : Momo
PRIORITY : N/A (not for part 1)
ESTIMATE : N/A
ISSUE    : Having a list of different types of drawable things in the
           model is cumbersome. In fact, it is currently incorrect, with
           Squiggle's not drawing properly. Need to re-architect the Model
           so that it is more flexible, and easier to work with.
           Consider some design patterns, or change of responsibility
           here.

ISSUE    : Squiggles are connected to each other by a straight line. Each drag

           the issue is with the representation of the squiggles in the Model.
